# Maze Game

## Why I made the game
It was my first ever experience with Unity and game building (so don't judge ok). In 2023, I applied to the Turkish company "Otsimo" for an internship. One of the requirements to qualify for the internship was to create a simple 2D maze game in 7 days with at least one level, which contained a rock to block movement and a deadly trap like lava to kill the player and reset the level. Additional levels and features were optional and I tried my best to include more levels and add more mechanics to the game within the time frame.

## About the game
Features a 5x5 maze, the player has to reach the goal without dying and while completing the challenges. A total of 3 levels of increasing difficulty and mechanics.

Use mouse to navigate the menus, WASD or arrow keys to control the player.
